			<h1 float:right>The roots of the NBA</h1>
			<p float:right>
				The NBA began life as the Basketball Association of America in 1946 and played under that monkier for 3 years before, in 1949,
				merging with the National Basketball League and changing names to the NBA.  
				The BAA started out with 11 teams in 1946 but lost four of them before the start of the next season. 
				Despite the loss of four teams the BAA was having a lot of success against its rival the NBL 
				and was able to entice four of the NBL's premire franchises to join the BAA in 1948.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the two leagues merged in 1949 it brought the total number of teams to 17 but the new league would quickly start losing teams.
				After just six years the number of teams had dropped to just 8. 
				Financial troubles plagued the league from the start and this was especially true for the NBL teams that joined during the merger due to them being in smaller markets.
				The owner of the Fort Wayne Pistons, a former NBL team, 
				named Frank Zollner was key in keeping the NBA financially afloat during this time.
			</p>
			<p>
				
				The NBA continued with 8 teams from 1955 until 1961 when the Chicago Packers joined the league.
				The Packers, now the Washington Wizards, are not considered to be the first expansion team, 
				that distriction goes to the Chicago Bulls because the Bulls, who joined in 1966, had an actual expansion draft. 
				From 1966 until 2004 the league seen an expansion boom with a total of 21 teams joining the league.
				
				The 1980s saw the league and the game of basketball grow termendously and a lot of that had to do with the rivalry of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.
				 The two have become the defination of what a rivalry is supposed to be and their teams would dominate the decade.
				 Because of this rivalry a lot of interest grew in the America about the NBA
				  and the first major TV deals started to be signed as well as another wave of expansion.
				
				The 1990s saw the age of Jordan.
				 No person in team sports has had such an impact that extended out side of the game.
				Jordan became the NBA and perhaps even bigger than the league. 
				Had it not been for a two year retirement Jordan may have won many more NBA titles.
				
				The post Jordan NBA seen an increase in international players joining the NBA. 
				The 2000s were truely an international league as players from every corner of the globe started joining the NBA and many of them,
				such as Dirk Nowitzki, started to find success in the league.

			<h2> The Long Weird History of the NBA Draft</h2>
			
			<p>        
				Every June fans line up waiting to see who their favorite NBA team will select in the draft.
				In today's NBA it is a pretty straight forward process. 
				Each team normally has 1 pick in the first round, 
				and 1 pick in the second round based on their record and maybe a little luck in the draft lottery. 
				But in the long history of the NBA draft things have not always been that simple. 
				Before the league started to curtail the draft in 1988 the rounds could go on and on indefinitely if they wanted them too.
				For example the 1960 draft had 21 rounds and the 1984 draft seen 228 players drafted.<br/>
				
				The process for the draft became cumbersome and the majority of the players selected after round three never played in the NBA.
				Several of the early drafts did not keep accurate records so its unknown which players went where in the draft, 
				each team is just listed as having selected players listed in an alphabetical record. 
				Basketball betting tips for the experts suggest that most of these players never even knew where they were drafted, 
				and the majority of them did not care as they planned to focus on other endeavors rather than the NBA.

			<h2>
				The Very First<abbr title="Baketball"> Basketball</abbr> Game in 1891
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				
				Surprisingly, unlike most sports whose origins are somewhat obscure, 
				often being the combination of other sports and developed gradually through time, 
				basketball has a very precise and fully known origin. 
				Even the date of the very first game is known, December 21, 1891. <br/>
		
				It was all started by Dr. James Naismith, the son of two Scottish immigrants to Canada. 
		
				By 1891, Dr. Naismith was teaching physical education in Springfield,
				MA at the YMCA International Training School; which today is Springfield College. 
				While there, he was asked by the director of physical education, Dr. Luther Gulick, 
				to come up with a new game students could play indoors during the winter, 
				that would help keep track and field runners in shape and would be relatively safe to play.
